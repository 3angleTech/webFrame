# Requirements


## For development environments

Make sure you have installed:

* NodeJS LTS v12+
* NPM v6+


### Integrated Development Environment

For consistent coding style we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

We recommend installing the following extensions:

* `Angular Language Services` - by Angular
* `Angular v6 Snippets` - by John Papa
* `Code Spell Checker` - by Street Side Software
* `EditorConfig for VS Code` - by EditorConfig
* `stylelint` - by shinnn
* `TSLint` - by egmma
* `TypeScript Importer` - by pmneo

> NOTE: For now, the `TypeScript Importer` is required for VSCode to support
> relative and absolute imports in the same project. In the future this will no
> longer be required.


## For production, testing or UAT environments

TODO: Add documentation.


### NOTES:

* Do not install development/build requirements on production servers.
* Always use production builds for production environments.
