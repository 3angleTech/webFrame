# app-shared modules

The `app-shared` modules export components, interfaces, services (etc) that are shared between other modules.

NOTES:
* modules MUST have the `SharedModule` suffix and their directory MUST NOT have a suffix.
* modules MUST contain an `index.ts` file that exposes all publicly available APIs.
